# TAS_demo
Uberlink Twitter Analytics Service (TAS) Demonstration Dataset.

Uberlink's [Twitter Analytics Service](http://uberlink.com/services/tas) provides the ability to access real-time streaming data from Twitterâ€™s Enterprise API platform, [GNIP](http://gnip.com/), and create a variety of social networks (complete with statistics) based upon connections between Twitter users.

This github repo contains a TAS demonstration dataset, and associated Perl and R scripts for working with the data. The dataset and code are designed to assist Uberlink TAS users to understand the data structure and quickly start working with the data.
